INFO:root:The George Mason University Natural Language Processing (NLP) group is a research group that focuses on the development and application of computational models of human language. The group is part of the larger Department of Computer Science at George Mason University.

The NLP group conducts research in various areas of natural language processing, including but not limited to:

1. Information Extraction: This involves automatically extracting structured information from unstructured text data. This can include tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction.

2. Text Mining: This involves discovering interesting and non-trivial patterns or knowledge from text data. This can include tasks such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and opinion mining.

3. Machine Translation: This involves automatically translating text from one language to another. This can include tasks such as statistical machine translation, neural machine translation, and multilingual NLP.

4. Question Answering: This involves building systems that can automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. This can include tasks such as factoid question answering, non-factoid question answering, and interactive question answering.

The group is led by faculty members who are experts in these areas and includes graduate and undergraduate students working on research projects. The group collaborates with other research groups and industry partners to apply their research to real-world problems.
